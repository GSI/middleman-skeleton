h1. middleman-skeleton


**Middleman-Skeleton** is the basic project structure as generated by @middleman init@ extended by configurations that enable compression by default.

Furthermore the layout helps to optimize for speed using suggestions from sites like **Google PageSpeed Insights**.

A key concept is to put styles for the upper part of any page into @stylesheets/essential@ while the as much as possible should go into @stylesheets/deferred@, allowing them to be loaded while any user is already capable of browsing the page.


h2. Usage


pre. git clone -o skeleton git@github.com:GSI/middleman-skeleton.git project.example.org
